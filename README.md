# Litime

Literature time clock to use in your terminal. I personaly run it when I open a new terminal, showing me a quote for the current time.

It's very hacked together, just as fun for myself. I used to have a python script doing this, which was 10 times slower than the resulting rust binary. I want to potentially look into how to make it even faster, just to learn more about Rust.
